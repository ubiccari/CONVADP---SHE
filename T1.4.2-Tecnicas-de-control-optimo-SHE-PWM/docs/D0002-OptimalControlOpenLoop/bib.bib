@article{Hoft1974,
abstract = {Theoretical techniques of voltage control for the half-bridge and full-bridge inverters are derived based on the results in[1]. Detailedanalytical results for the symmetrical pulsewidth modulation method of voltage control are also presented. Voltage control techniques are derived whereby harmonic elimination is possible in variable-frequency variable-voltage three-phase inverter circuits. The technique for the half-bridge inverter is optimized subject to the constraint of switching frequency of the SCR's, using the concepts of modern control theory. Variable-frequency variable-voltage sinusoidal output in three-phase inverters is possible by employing the techniques developed. The methods show great promise in application to variable-speed ac motor drive systems. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1974 by The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.},
